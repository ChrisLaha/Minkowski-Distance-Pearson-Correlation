# Minkowski-Distance-Pearson-Correlation

* Create a class with functions to calculate Pearson Correlation, and Minkowski/Manhattan/Euclidean distance.
* Distance or similarity measures are essential in solving many pattern recognition problems such as classification or clustering. 
* Minkowski distance is a generalized distance metric. 
* Manhattan distance, also known as city block distance, or taxi cab geometry is used if we need to calculate the distance between two data points in a grid-like path.
* Euclidean distance is the straight line distance between two data points in a plane.
